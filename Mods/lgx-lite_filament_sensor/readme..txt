BOM:
2x 6mm FHCS - needs to be stainless to avoid interference with the HALL sensor.
1x 3mm DIN washer - needs to be steel to interact properly with the HALL sensor.
1x AH3364Q-P-B hall sensor.
1x 6x3mm magnet.
Directions:
Print orientation already set.
Regular Voron settings.
Get the screw started about 2mm.
Insert AH3364Q-P-B in it's slot.
Tighten down the screw while making sure the AH3364Q-P-B is still seated properly in the sensor housing.
Insert the and then the washer in their locations.
Snip off a stump of 1.75mm filament and insert it into the hole in the side of the sensor body to retain the washer (and trim it to size, but leave enough that you can still use some pliers to remove it).
Do a bench test with some filament and check that it can pass through the sensor without any issues.
Cut a piece of PTFE with the jig and insert it to the top/filament entrence of your LGX-lite.
Mount the filament sensor with a the remaining 6mm FHCS (i'm not 100% sure if I used a 6mm or 8mm).

I'm not gonna go into how you're supposed to solder, wire up & configure the HALL sensor for your machine but there’s more than enough information on the internet for you to figgure that out yourself ;)
